Thank you for the opportunity to showcase my skills to you. 
This wasn't very easy for me, given the time constraints (I had one day to do it) 
and the little details to implement to make the site an exact copy 
of the provided pictures. I'm happy with the fact that the code 
compiles with no errors on the console and shows no errors when 
I ran it through the HTML and CSS Validator. I tried to keep the 
coloring the same and the general layout consistent with a few tweaks. 
The hamburger menu is a hover-over menu because that is what I prefer 
for efficiency and cleanliness on a site, and I decided to put it on the right, so you 
are always able to access it when on the site, and to add symmetry to 
the site. While this is definitely my best effort given the time for 
the project, there are some improvements I would make. I would create 
a background in Illustrator instead of making one in code because it 
would look nicer and move better when changing the page size, but I 
don't have an active subscription to Adobe and felt this would suffice.
As the screen shrinks, the data is dynamically moving as intended, but the 
picture does get cutoff, and I would also like to learn and then implement 
the ability to change the hamburger menu to a full bar menu as seen in the pictures, 
as this would aid in future projects as well. I hope that you see my potential with this 
exercise and will choose me for the Web Developer role. I would love to 
learn more about it and see how my skills can impact PNY in the future. Thank you!
